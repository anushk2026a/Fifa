## What is this?

A FIFA World Cup 2026 **information directory**. A fan arrives and quickly answers three questions:

1. **Which match & when?** — today's / tomorrow's matches + full FIFA schedule link
2. **Where is it?** — the host city and its stadium
3. **What's around it?** — restaurants (1 / 2 / 5 / 10 mi), hotels (5 / 10 mi), transport, tickets, and screening zones near each stadium

Most of the site is **curated links and content**. The only dynamic piece is **Contact Us**, which emails the team via SMTP so fans can ask which stadium hosts their match or how to get there.

## Architecture

A simple two-app setup (see [`/docs`](./docs/README.md)):

| App | Stack | Hosts | Role |
|-----|-------|-------|------|
| **`frontend/`** | Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui | Vercel | The whole public site (prerendered) |
| **`backend/`** | Express + TypeScript (**modular monolith**), Nodemailer (SMTP) | Render / Railway | The Contact feature (emails submissions) |

- **Frontend** is **feature-wise**: `components/{home,city,news,contact,common}`, content in `src/data`, helpers in `src/lib`.
- **Backend** is a **modular monolith**: feature modules under `src/modules/<feature>` (currently `contact`, `health`), shared code in `src/shared`.
- No database, Redis, queues, or Docker. Content lives in `frontend/src/data`.

> See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for the repo working agreement.

## Pages

| Route | Page |
|-------|------|
| `/` | Home (Sports) |
| `/locations` | All 16 cities |
| `/cities/[slug]` | Individual city page |
| `/news` | News |

### 16 Host Cities

**USA** — Atlanta · Boston · Dallas · Houston · Kansas City · Los Angeles · Miami · New York/New Jersey · Philadelphia · San Francisco Bay Area · Seattle
**Canada** — Toronto · Vancouver
**Mexico** — Mexico City · Guadalajara · Monterrey

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: **Node.js 18+** and **npm**.

### Frontend (the website)

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.local.example .env.local      # set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to the backend URL
npm install
npm run dev                           # http://localhost:3000
npm run build                         # production build (Vercel runs Next.js natively)
```

### Backend (the contact API)

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env                  # set SMTP_* and CONTACT_TO (Gmail App Password works)
npm install
npm run dev                           # http://localhost:4000  (GET /health to check)
npm run build && npm start            # production
```

The contact form needs **both** running locally: the frontend posts to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` → `POST /api/contact` → SMTP email.

## Deployment
## 🚀 Setup & Development

1. **Clone & Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fifa.git
   cd Fifa/frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add your SMTP credentials (e.g. Gmail App Password) for the contact form to work locally.

3. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🌍 Deployment

### Vercel (Frontend & Serverless API)
The entire project is built to deploy on Vercel natively.
1. Import the `frontend` folder into a new Vercel project.
2. In Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables, add:
   - `SMTP_HOST` (e.g. `smtp.gmail.com`)
   - `SMTP_PORT` (e.g. `587`)
   - `SMTP_SECURE` (`false`)
   - `SMTP_USER` (your email)
   - `SMTP_PASS` (your app password)
   - `MAIL_FROM`
   - `CONTACT_TO`
3. Deploy!

> **Secrets:** keep SMTP credentials in `frontend/.env.local` (git-ignored) locally and in the host's env settings in production. Never commit them. Gmail uses an **App Password**, not your account password.

## Key Principles

1. **Static-first.** A fast site with almost no backend; add complexity only when needed.
2. **Links, not heavy APIs.** Curated outbound links; the fan clicks out to official sources.
3. **One predictable city-page layout** — learn it once, know every city.
4. **Content-first design** — clean, legible, not "AI-generated"; no decorative shadow soup.
5. **Modular monolith (backend) + feature-wise (frontend)** so the codebase grows cleanly.
